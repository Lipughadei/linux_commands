Here are the steps to create an Amazon EC2 instance in AWS using a shell script. This guide will walk you through the process of writing a shell script that utilizes the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to launch an EC2 instance.

Step 1: Install and Configure AWS CLI

Ensure that you have the AWS CLI installed on your Linux machine. You can install it using the following command:
bash
sudo apt-get install awscli  # For Debian/Ubuntu
# or
sudo yum install aws-cli      # For CentOS/RHEL
Configure the AWS CLI with your credentials:
bash
aws configure
You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, region, and output format.

Step 2: Create a Directory for Your Script

Organize your scripts by creating a directory:
bash
mkdir ~/aws-scripts
cd ~/aws-scripts
Step 3: Create the Shell Script File

Create a new shell script file:
bash
touch create_ec2_instance.sh
Step 4: Make the Script Executable

Change the permissions to make the script executable:
bash
chmod +x create_ec2_instance.sh
Step 5: Edit the Shell Script

Open the script in a text editor:
bash
nano create_ec2_instance.sh
Add the following content to the script. This example launches a t2.micro instance using a specified AMI ID, instance type, key pair, security group, and subnet ID.
bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
AMI_ID="ami-0d70546e43a941d70"  # Replace with your AMI ID
INSTANCE_TYPE="t2.micro"
KEY_NAME="your-key-pair"        # Replace with your key pair name
SECURITY_GROUP="your-sg-id"     # Replace with your security group ID
SUBNET_ID="your-subnet-id"       # Replace with your subnet ID

# Create EC2 instance
aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id $AMI_ID \
    --count 1 \
    --instance-type $INSTANCE_TYPE \
    --key-name $KEY_NAME \
    --security-group-ids $SECURITY_GROUP \
    --subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \
    --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=MyInstance}]'

echo "EC2 instance created successfully."
Save the file and exit the editor (in nano, press CTRL + X, then Y, and Enter).

Step 6: Run the Shell Script

Execute the script to create the EC2 instance:
bash
./create_ec2_instance.sh
Step 7: Verify the Instance Creation

After running the script, you can verify that the instance has been created by listing your instances:
bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=MyInstance"
Conclusion

You have successfully created a shell script to launch an EC2 instance in AWS. Make sure to replace the placeholder values in the script with your actual AWS resource identifiers. You can further customize the script to include additional configurations as needed.
