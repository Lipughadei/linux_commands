Accessing a Server in a Private Subnet: Steps and Process

When a user needs to access a server located within a private subnet, they cannot directly connect to the server due to security and networking constraints. Here are the steps and process the user would typically undergo to access the server:

Step 1: Authentication and Authorization

The user initiates a request to access the server, which is routed to a bastion host or a jump server.
The bastion host or jump server authenticates the user using credentials such as username and password, or other authentication mechanisms like multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Once authenticated, the user is authorized to access the private subnet based on their role, permissions, and access control lists (ACLs).
Step 2: Establishing a Secure Connection

The user establishes a secure connection to the bastion host or jump server using a secure protocol such as SSH (Secure Shell) or VPN (Virtual Private Network).
The secure connection ensures that all communication between the user's device and the bastion host or jump server is encrypted and protected from eavesdropping or tampering.
Step 3: Routing to the Private Subnet

The bastion host or jump server routes the user's request to the private subnet, which is not directly accessible from the public internet.
The private subnet is typically configured with a non-routable IP address range, such as 10.0.0.0/8 or 192.168.0.0/16, to prevent direct access from the internet.
Step 4: Accessing the Server

The user's request is forwarded to the server within the private subnet, which is configured to accept incoming connections from the bastion host or jump server.
The user can now access the server using a remote desktop protocol (RDP), SSH, or other remote access protocols.
Additional Security Measures

To further enhance security, additional measures may be implemented, such as:
Network segmentation: dividing the private subnet into smaller, isolated segments to limit lateral movement in case of a breach.
Firewall rules: configuring firewalls to restrict incoming and outgoing traffic to specific IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
Monitoring and logging: tracking user activity and system events to detect and respond to potential security incidents.
By following these steps and processes, users can securely access servers located within private subnets, while maintaining the security and integrity of the network and its
